Goal: I want a program for dijisktras algorithm

Plan created: dijkstra_solver.py -> find_shortest_paths
Steps: ["Define the function 'find_shortest_paths' accepting the graph (as an adjacency dictionary mapping nodes to a list of (neighbor, weight) tuples) and the start node.", "Initialize a dictionary 'distances' where the start node distance is 0 and all other nodes are infinity (use float('inf')).", "Initialize a 'priority_queue' (min-heap) and push the tuple (0, start_node).", "Initialize a dictionary 'predecessors' to track the path taken to reach each node.", "While the 'priority_queue' is not empty, pop the node (current_distance, current_node) with the smallest distance.", "If the current_distance is greater than the recorded distance in the 'distances' dictionary for the current_node, continue (skip processing stale entries).", 'Iterate through all neighbors and their weights defined in the graph for the current_node.', "Calculate the new distance (current_distance + weight). If the new distance is less than the neighbor's currently recorded distance, update the neighbor's distance in 'distances', update its predecessor in 'predecessors', and push the tuple (new_distance, neighbor) onto the 'priority_queue'.", "Return the 'distances' dictionary and the 'predecessors' dictionary."]
