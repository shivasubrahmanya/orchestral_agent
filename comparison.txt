### Comparison between Dijkstra Execution Runs

**Case 1: `dijkstra.py` (The First Run)**
*   **Log File:** `dijkstra_execution_log.txt`
*   **Outcome:** FAILURE ❌
*   **What Happened:** The "Coder" agent successfully introduced a bug as intended by the workflow.
*   **The Problem:** The tests failed (specifically `test_dijkstra_complex_network`). The algorithm calculated a distance of `6` instead of the expected `7`.
*   **The Fix:** The "Fixer" agent attempted to repair the code, but the fix didn't work, so it failed the final verification. This demonstrates a case where the agent struggled to self-heal complex logic discrepancies.

**Case 2: `dijkstra_solver.py` (The Second Run)**
*   **Log File:** `dijkstra_solver_execution_log.txt`
*   **Outcome:** SUCCESS ✅
*   **What Happened:** The "Coder" agent **failed to create a bug**. It accidentally wrote perfect code on the initial draft.
*   **The Log Warning:** `WARNING: Tests passed unexpectedly! The Coder failed to insert a bug.`
*   **The Result:** Since the code was already correct, it passed the "Fixing" and "Verification" phases immediately without needing actual repairs.
