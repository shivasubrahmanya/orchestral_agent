Steps: ["Define the function accepting two arguments: 'graph' (a dictionary representing the adjacency list, e.g., Node -> List[(Neighbor, Weight)]) and 'start_node'.", "Initialize a dictionary 'distances' mapping all nodes in the graph to infinity, except for the 'start_node', which should be mapped to 0.", "Initialize a 'priority_queue' (min-heap) and push the tuple (0, start_node) representing (distance, node).", 'Begin a loop that continues while the priority queue is not empty.', "In each iteration, extract the node 'current_node' and its 'current_distance' with the smallest distance from the priority queue.", "If 'current_distance' is strictly greater than the stored distance in the 'distances' dictionary for 'current_node', skip this iteration (handling stale entries).", "Iterate through all 'neighbor' and 'weight' pairs associated with the 'current_node' in the graph.", "Calculate the 'new_distance' as the 'current_distance' plus the 'weight' of the edge to the neighbor.", "If 'new_distance' is less than the current stored distance for the 'neighbor' in the 'distances' dictionary, update the neighbor's distance and push the tuple ('new_distance', 'neighbor') onto the priority queue.", "Return the final 'distances' dictionary."]

--- Phase 7: Final Judgment ---
FAILURE: 1 test failed (test_dijkstra_complex_network). The test failed because the distance for Node 5 was expected to be 7 but the actual result was 6. (1 failed, 6 passed).
